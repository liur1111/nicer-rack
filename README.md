## Installation

After downloading the repo, install all necessary depencies by running in the root folder:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Accessing Raspberry Pi

On your own machine, SSH into the Raspi: `ssh putz@18.18.248.96`

Ask for the password if you need it. From here, you can access the Raspberry Pi's Software Configuration Tool (settings): `sudo raspi-config`

**Don't mess around with the settings.** But, if you want to update the Raspi, navigate to `8 Update` using the arrow keys, and hit enter to update. When it's done, tab your way to `Finish`, then hit enter.

You can navigate the filesystem the way any computer works. Some potentially useful commands:
* `sudo reboot`
* `sudo shutdown -h now` will safely shut down the Raspi
* `wget [url]` will download the file at the given URL to the Raspi, in whatever your working directory is.

## Web server

After making changes to config files, run `apache2ctl configtest` and make sure it doesn't throw any errors.

The main page of this site is located (on default) at `/var/www/html/index.html`. You can look at the config documentation at `/usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz`. By default, Debian does not allow access through the web browser to any file apart of those located in `/var/www`, **public_html** directories (when enabled) and `/usr/share` (for web applications). If your site is using a web document root located elsewhere (such as in `/srv`) you may need to whitelist your document root directory in `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`.

If you're having connection timeout issues or otherwise want to change server settings, go look at the `etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file.

To change folder location of `index.html` file:
* Change the DocumentRoot field in the config file to the correct filepath
* The default config file is at `/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`, but you can find the nicerack config file at `etc/apache2/sites-available/nicerack.conf`
* Current location: /var/www/nicer-rack/nicer_rack_web/client/dist
* Restart apache server using `service apache2 restart`

For issues with installing llvmlite, try the following where # is the llvm version (integer?):
```
sudo apt install llvm-#
LLVM_CONFIG=llvm-config-# pip install llvmlite
```
